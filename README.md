### [Awesome DDD](https://github.com/heynickc/awesome-ddd)

### 1. What Is Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
      - Building Domain Knowledge

### 2. The Ubiquitous Language
      - The Need for a Common Language
      - Creating the Ubiquitous Language
      - The Building Blocks Of A Model-Driven Design
      - Layered Architecture
            - Entities
            - Value Objects
            - Services
            - Modules
            - Aggregates
            - Factories
            - Repositories

### 3. Refactoring Toward Deeper Insight
      - Continuous Refactoring
      - Bring Key Concepts Into Light

### 4. Preserving Model Integrity - 
      - Maintaining the Integrity of Domain Models with Bounded Contexts
      - Maintaining the Integrity of Domain Models with Continuous Integration
      - Maintaining the Integrity of Domain Models with Context Map
            - Shared Kernel
            - Customer-Supplier
            - Conformist
            - Anticorruption Layer
            - Separate Ways
            - Open Host Service
            - Distillation

### 5. Strategic design  with 
        - Bounded Context and Ubiquitious language
        - Subdomains
        - ContextMap 
        - Aggregates 

### 6.  Integrating via Messaging

### 8. Tactical Patterns: Creating Effective Domain Models
        - Domain Modeling Building Blocks
                - aggregates
                - Entities
                - Value Objects
                - domain services
                - domain events 
                - factories
                - repositories 
                - Event sourcing 
                
### 9. Design Patterns for Effective Applications
