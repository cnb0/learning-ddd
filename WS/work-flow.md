## Schedule

The timeframes are only estimates and may vary according to how the class is progressing.

```
1. Introduction – Why Are We Here? 
            - Presentation: What Domain-driven design is and how it can help
            - Discussion: Expectations for the session
            
2. Collaborating with Domain Experts 
           - Presentation: Collaborating with Domain Experts
            
3. First Steps Modelling Our Domain  
            - Exercise: First steps modelling our domain
            
4. What can a model do? 
            - Discussion: What are models used for?
            - Presentation: What a model can do (with some relatable examples - tube maps, etc.)
            - Discussion: Did we model too much or too little in the first exercise?
            
5. Actors, activities and fewer things 
            - Exercise: Add modules (packages) and move our classes into them
            
6. Refactoring for Greater Clarity 
            - Add modules (packages) and move our classes into
            
7. Our Model Breaks / We Have a Breakthrough 
            - Exercise: Include new detail in our model (from later on in the domain expert statement)
            - Presentation: What broke, what we discussed with the Domain Expert, the deeper insight we gained as a result
            - Discussion: How did you feel doing that? Are you still happy with your model?
            
8. Splitting our model 
            - Exercise: Splitting our model
            - Discussion: How does having duplication between your models make you feel?
            
9. Taking these skills out into the world and experimenting (Wrap Up) 
            - Presentation: Summary of key DDD topics we covered, techniques we used, and 
              further reading (highlighting the aspects of Domain-driven design - 
              we’ve encountered - ubiquitous language, hands on modellers, multiple models and more)
            - Closing Discussion
